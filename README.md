# Pune Property Price Prediction

This project aims to predict property prices in Pune using **Linear Regression**. By leveraging features such as `location`, `BHK`, `square footage`, and `price`, the model is trained to estimate property prices. The project includes essential steps like **data preprocessing**, **outlier removal**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **cross-validation** to ensure high accuracy and model robustness.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of properties in Pune using data about various property features. The project uses **Linear Regression** to build the prediction model and applies various techniques like **outlier removal**, **data cleaning**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to improve model performance.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Predicts Property Prices**: Uses features like `location`, `BHK`, `total_sqft`, and `price` to predict property prices.
- **Cross-Validation**: Uses **ShuffleSplit** and **cross-validation** to evaluate the model's accuracy, achieving around **85% accuracy** on average.
- **Outlier Removal**: Implements methods to remove **outliers** from the data based on price per square foot (price_per_sqft).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performs necessary data transformations like feature scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes the data visually to discover trends, correlations, and key insights.

## üìä Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and validation techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the code in an interactive environment.
